## File upload into server folder and database with loader php

### It is based on following libraries and languages-
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. JavaScript
4. PHP
5. jQuery

### Description:

This php based project to upload large file into server or database. 

### Problem: 
When we or user uploads a file on website it take time to upload. If file is big in size, then it takes more time, by that user have no idea weather the file is uploading or not. Sometimes user used to refresh the tab, if it's taking more time.

### Solution:
For this I've created a loader bar. That will display the % of file uploaded with a loading icon.
